# Deep-Learning-Based-Paddy-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Deep learning–based paddy leaf disease detection using the Paddy Doctor dataset. The system classifies 13 disease classes by combining leaf images with metadata like crop variety and age. Attention-based CNN models improve accuracy and robustness for real-field agricultural diagnosis.


# Paddy Leaf Disease Classification 🌾

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on classifying paddy (rice) leaf images to identify plant diseases using machine learning techniques. Early detection of crop diseases helps farmers take preventive measures and improve agricultural productivity.

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect whether a paddy leaf is healthy or diseased
- Classify common paddy leaf diseases using image data
- Reduce dependency on manual inspection

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Collected paddy leaf images (healthy and diseased)
2. Performed image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
3. Trained a CNN model for classification
4. Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics
5. Predicted disease class for new leaf images

## ✅ Results
- Achieved reliable classification accuracy
- Successfully identified diseased paddy leaves from images
- Can be extended to real-time or mobile-based systems

## 🌱 Applications
- Smart agriculture
- Crop disease monitoring
- Farmer decision support systems

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add more disease categories
- Deploy as a web or mobile application
- Improve accuracy using advanced CNN architectures
